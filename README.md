# ABOUT
Adb_Controller is a python script that is used to perform basic controls over a remote adb device on the local network. It was designed to run on linux_x86_64. However feel free to check out the references and run it on another operating system.

---

# USAGE
- `python3 gui.py <IP>` where `<IP>` is the ip address of the device you would like to connect to.

- The device script is written independent of the gui so it can be used in sync with other python files to connect to an adb device through code.
